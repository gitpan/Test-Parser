Test::Parser is a collection of parsers for different test output file
formats. These parse the data into a general purpose data structure that
can then be used to create reports, do post-processing analysis, etc. It
can also export tests in SpikeSource's TRPI test description XML language.

Every test seems to have its own unique output format.  This isn't a
problem if you only need to deal with results from one or two tests, but
the more tests you want to work with, the more tiresome it gets to
create parsers for the formats.  This package aims to solve this problem
by providing a collection point for test parsers, and implementing a
standardized output format that can be relied on for creation of test
reports.  We hope to gain the following benefits:

   - Uniformity in dealing with test parsing
   - Easier, more flexible and professional reports, eventually including
        - Analysis
        - Plotting
        - Diffs/Comparisons
        - Easy unit conversions
        - Ease of dealing with complex data
        - Searching/Querying
   - Easier data exchange between testing organisations
